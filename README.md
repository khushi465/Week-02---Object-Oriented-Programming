# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Welcome to Week 2 of our Java learning journey. This week focused on understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java and how to apply them using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Overview

Week 2 introduced the core concepts of object-oriented programming in Java. We explored classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. We also learned how to use the Eclipse IDE and visualize object-oriented structures using diagrams.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: OOP Introduction

- Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming Languages  
- Class and Object  

### Day 2: Constructors and Variable Scope

- Java Constructors  
- Instance vs. Class Variables  
- Access Modifiers Concepts (`public`, `private`, `protected`, default)  

### Day 3: Keywords and Tools

- `this` keyword  
- `static` keyword  
- `final` keyword  
- `instanceof` operator  
- Eclipse Editor Introduction and Use  

### Day 4: UML Diagrams and Class Design

- Classes vs. Objects in Java  
- Class Diagram  
- Object Diagram  
- Sequence Diagram  

### Day 5: Inheritance

- Inheritance  
- Single-Level Inheritance  
- Multilevel Inheritance  
- Hierarchical Inheritance  
- Key Features of Inheritance  
- Method Overriding  
- Constructor Inheritance in Java  
- Polymorphism and Inheritance  
- Access Modifiers and Inheritance  

### Day 6: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface & Abstraction

- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime)  
- Interface  
- Abstract Classes  

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1: Java Basics  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
- Eclipse IDE installed and configured  

## How to Use This Repository

The repository is structured by day, with folders containing code examples, notes, and exercises. Review the content, try running the code, and experiment with modifications to enhance your understanding.

## Next Steps

In Week 3, we will explore exception handling, file input/output, and Java collections in more depth to continue building our Java expertise.
